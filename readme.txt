Pork to Sausage is a plugin for Notepad++ that allows you to transform selected text from one format to another. For example, you can convert clear text to zip text encoded in base64, or decode an encoded URL to a clear URL. Some transformations are easy to implement in C or C++, while others can be done more easily in Java or .NET using their rich libraries.

The idea behind Pork to Sausage is to create a plugin that can pass any selected text to a command-line program as input and replace the selected text with the output of the program. To use the plugin, you need to write a transformer in your favorite language. The transformer should take input from a file or stdin and generate output to a file or stdout.

To configure your transformer, you can edit the pork2sausage.ini file. The plugin supports up to 20 commands that can be customized to suit your needs.

Enjoy your sausage ;)
